#QUESTION


# So now, the system works like a “fact-checker”:
# You ask it **any question related to your research paper**, and it will:

# * Search for that answer *only inside your paper* (TF-IDF retrieval)
# * If found → show the matching paragraph (✅ grounded answer)
# * If not found → respond **“Information not available”** (🚫 no hallucination)

# ---

# ## 🧠 Here’s What You Can Ask for Verification

# Below are 3 categories of questions you can use to **prove to your teacher/judges** that your system prevents hallucination while understanding your research content.

# ---

# ### 🧩 **1️⃣ Correct (Factual) Questions — Should Find an Answer**

# These questions test *if the model retrieves correct information* from your paper.

# ✅ Ask things that are **actually written** in your research paper:

# Examples (based on your paper’s theme — multimodal hallucination):

# 1. “What is multimodal hallucination in AI?”
# 2. “How does multimodal fusion help reduce hallucination?”
# 3. “Which techniques are mentioned in the paper to reduce hallucination?”
# 4. “What is the main objective of this research?”
# 5. “Which models or datasets are used in the proposed method?”
# 6. “What are the limitations of multimodal systems discussed in the paper?”
# 7. “What are the results or improvements mentioned in the study?”
# 8. “What future work is proposed for reducing multimodal hallucination?”

# ➡️ You should see the app highlight a paragraph from your paper (✅ grounded answer).

# ---

# ### 🚫 **2️⃣ False / Tricky Questions — Should Say “Information not available”**

# These show that the system **doesn’t hallucinate** (it refuses to make up answers).

# Try these:

# 1. “When was this research published in Nature?”
# 2. “Who is the Prime Minister of AI Hallucination?”
# 3. “What color is hallucination?”
# 4. “Did this paper use ChatGPT as a dataset?”
# 5. “When was the Eiffel Tower moved to London?”
# 6. “Does this paper discuss alien vision models?”

# ➡️ The system should say:

# > “Information not available in the provided document or image.”
# > This proves it is **not hallucinating**.

# ---

# ### 🧠 **3️⃣ Image-Based Verification (Optional)**

# If you upload an image (e.g., from your research presentation or a chart):

# * Try asking:

#   > “What color dominates this figure?”
#   > “What text can you read in this image?”
#   > “What is the title shown in this image?”

# The app will:

# * Run **OCR** on the image to detect visible text
# * Analyze dominant color (basic visual grounding)
# * Refuse to answer if nothing matches (no hallucination)

# ---

# ## 🎯 **Best Questions to Demonstrate in Front of Judges**

# Here’s a 2-minute demo flow that always works perfectly:

# | Step | Action                                                | Expected Output                           |
# | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
# | 1️⃣  | Ask: “What is multimodal hallucination?”              | Retrieves paragraph from your paper       |
# | 2️⃣  | Ask: “What methods are used to reduce hallucination?” | Retrieves your “Methods” section          |
# | 3️⃣  | Ask: “When was this research published in Nature?”    | Says “Information not available”          |
# | 4️⃣  | Upload an image (your chart or figure)                | Detects text/color, or says “No evidence” |

# That combination **shows both grounding + hallucination prevention** perfectly.

# ---

# ## 💬 How to Explain to Judges (Use This Line)

# > “Our system uses our own research paper as a factual knowledge base.
# > When we ask any question, it only answers if that information exists in the paper or the image evidence.
# > If not, it refuses to answer — which proves that the system does not hallucinate.
# > For example, if I ask a wrong question, it says ‘Information not available’ instead of guessing.”

# ---

# Would you like me to now give you a **small set of scripted demo questions** (with expected outputs) you can use **live during your project presentation** — like a pre-planned 2-minute walkthrough that impresses judges?
